# Kora Documentation

Welcome to the Kora documentation.

This directory contains both **user-facing documentation** and **internal design
documents** that describe how the language is built.

If you are new to the project, start with the overview and work your way down.

## Getting Started

- **[Overview](overview.md)**  
  High-level introduction to Kora: what it is, why it exists, and when to use it.

- **[Manifesto](manifesto.md)**  
  The design principles and non-negotiable values that guide Kora’s evolution.

---

## Architecture & Design

- **[Architecture](architecture.md)**  
  Explains the internal structure of the Kora implementation: lexer, parser, AST, and runtime pipeline.

## Language Reference (Coming Soon)

- `language.md`  
  Formal description of Kora’s syntax and semantics.
